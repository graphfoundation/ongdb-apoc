By participating, you  are expected to uphold this code.

Please report unacceptable behavior to feedback@neo4j.com.

[[quickstart]]
== Quickstart

For the impatient, if you want to submit a quick pull request:

* Make sure there is link:issues[an issue].
* Make sure you submit test cases (unit or integration tests) that back your changes.
* Try not to amend existing test cases but create new ones dedicated to the changes you're making to the codebase. 
* Try to test as locally as possible but potentially also add integration tests.

* The commit message:
** First line is the subject with the essence of the change, add "fixes #issue"
** In the description, add reasoning for changes.

* Make sure you provide your full name and an email address registered with your GitHub account.

NOTE: If you're a first-time submitter, make sure you have signed the https://neo4j.com/developer/cla/[Contributor License Agreement].

[[advanced]]
== Advanced

This section contains some advanced information.

[[advanced.general]]
=== General

Fix bugs in the latest development branch first, if it's reasonable to port the fix back into an older branch, try to do so with cherry picking.

Try to keep the lifespan of a feature branch as short as possible. For simple bug fixes they should only be used for code review in pull requests.

On longer running feature branches, don't pull changes that were made to master in the meantime.
Instead, rebase the feature branch onto current master, sorting out issues and making sure the branch will fast-forward merge eventually.

[[advanced.change-tracking]]
=== Change tracking

Make sure you don't send a PR without referring to an issue.

Try to resolve a issue in a single commit. I.e. don't have separate commits for the fix and the test cases.

NOTE: Avoid MERGE commits as they just tend to make it hard to understand what comes from where.
If there are multiple commits, and the PR is fine to merge online, use *Squash and Merge* on GitHub.

Using the issue id in the summary line will allow us to keep track of commits belonging together.

=== Branching Policy

We do have a branch for each major version of Neo4j, e.g. `3.5`, `4.0` and `4.1`. 
As a contributor you're asked to use newest possible branch for you PR.

When your PR is accepted and merged it's the responsibility of the maintainers who merged it to cherry-pick that changes to any newer branch. 
Once cherry-picking is done, the maintainers should mark that PR with the `cherry-picked` label. 

Please indicate in your PR message text if your PR needs a different behaviour - e.g.  if the feature you're fixing has been removed in a newer branch or APIs have changed too much and you have a separate PR for the newer branch.

EXAMPLE: 

1. You're fixing a bug being reported for 3.5.x.x. 
2. You're choosing the 3.5 branch as base for your PR branch. 
3. Once you're done you send a PR.
4. When a maintainer merges that PR, they also take care to cherry-pick it to 4.0 and any more recent branches.

=== Handling pull requests

Be polite. 
It might be the first time someone contributes to an OpenSource project so we should forgive violations to the contribution guidelines. 
Use some gut feeling to find out in how far it makes sense to ask the reporter to fix stuff or just go ahead and add a polishing commit yourself.

Before we accept a non-trivial patch or pull request we will need you to https://neo4j.com/developer/cla/[sign the Contributor License Agreement]. 
Signing the contributorâ€™s agreement does not grant anyone commit rights to the main repository, but it does mean that we can accept your contributions, and you will get an author credit if we do.

If you decide to cherry-pick commits back to older branches make sure that all the infrastructure requirements are met (e.g. API changes etc).
If there are issues you can fix them directly and then use `git add -u && git cherry-pick --continue`
Build & test them locally first before pushing.

Before merging stuff back into the main branch, make sure you rebase your PR branch, so that there are no conflicts.
We generally do not allow merge commits, so a merge should always be fast-forward. 
The issues IDs and the timestamps give enough tracking information already.

The simplest way to merge back a more complex pull request (with multiple commits) submitted by someone external is `curl`ing the patch into `git am`. 
You can then polish it by either adding a commit or amending the provided commit and rebase interactively / squash locally. 
Combine the commit messages and edit them to make sense.

Make sure you keep the original author when amending.

curl $PULL_REQUEST_URL.patch | git am --ignore-whitespace

Make sure to push changes to a PR to the original remote branch.
This will cause the pull request UI in GitHub show and link those commits.
