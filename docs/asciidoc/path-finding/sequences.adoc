Path expander procedures can expand on repeating sequences of labels, relationship types, or both.
Sequences can be defined as follows:

* If only using label sequences, use the `labelFilter`, but use commas to separate the filtering for each step in the repeating sequence.
* If only using relationship sequences, use the `relationshipFilter`, but use commas to separate the filtering for each step of the repeating sequence.
* If using sequences of both relationships and labels, use the `sequence` parameter.

|===
| Usage | config param | description | syntax | explanation
| label sequences only | labelFilter | Same syntax and filters, but uses commas (`,`) to separate the filters for each step in the sequence. |
 labelFilter:'Post\|-Blocked,Reply,>Admin' | Start node must be a :Post node that isn't :Blocked, next node must be a :Reply, and the next must be an :Admin, then repeat if able. Only paths ending with the `:Admin` node in that position of the sequence will be returned.
| relationship sequences only | relationshipFilter | Same syntax, but uses commas (`,`) to separate the filters for each relationship traversal in the sequence. |
relationshipFilter:'NEXT>,<FROM,POSTED>\|REPLIED>' | Expansion will first expand `NEXT>` from the start node, then `<FROM`, then either `POSTED>` or `REPLIED>`, then repeat if able.
| sequences of both labels and relationships | sequence | A string of comma-separated alternating label and relationship filters, for each step in a repeating sequence. The sequence should begin with a label filter, and end with a relationship filter. If present, `labelFilter`, and `relationshipFilter` are ignored, as this takes priority. |
sequence:'Post\|-Blocked, NEXT>, Reply, <FROM, >Admin, POSTED>\|REPLIED>'  | Combines the behaviors above.

There are some uses cases where the sequence does not begin at the start node, but at one node distant.

The config parameter `beginSequenceAtStart` toggles this behavior.
Its default value is `true`.
If set to `false`, this changes the expected values for `labelFilter`, `relationshipFilter`, and `sequence` as noted below:

| sequence | altered behavior | example | explanation
| labelFilter | The start node is not considered part of the sequence. The sequence begins one node off from the start node. |
beginSequenceAtStart:false, labelFilter:'Post\|-Blocked,Reply,>Admin' | The next node(s) out from the start node begins the sequence (and must be a :Post node that isn't :Blocked), and only paths ending with `Admin` nodes returned.
| relationshipFilter | The first relationship filter in the sequence string will not be considered part of the repeating sequence, and will only be used for the first relationship from the start node to the node that will be the actual start of the sequence. |
beginSequenceAtStart:false, relationshipFilter:'FIRST>,NEXT>,<FROM,POSTED>\|REPLIED>' | `FIRST>` will be traversed just from the start node to the node that will be the start of the repeating `NEXT>,<FROM,POSTED>\|REPLIED>` sequence.
| sequence | Combines the above two behaviors. |
beginSequenceAtStart:false, sequence:'FIRST>, Post\|-Blocked, NEXT>, Reply, <FROM, >Admin, POSTED>\|REPLIED>' | Combines the behaviors above.
