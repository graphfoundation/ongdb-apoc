.Sequence tips

Label filtering in sequences work together with the `endNodes`+`terminatorNodes`, though inclusion of a node must be unanimous.

If you need to limit the number of times a sequence repeats, this can be done with the `maxLevel` config param (multiply the number of iterations with the size of the nodes in the sequence).
