| input | result
| -Foe | blacklist filter - No node in the path will have a label in the blacklist.
| +Friend | whitelist filter - All nodes in the path must have a label in the whitelist (exempting termination and end nodes, if using those filters).
If no whitelist operator is present, all labels are considered whitelisted.
| /Friend | termination filter - Only return paths up to a node of the given labels, and stop further expansion beyond it.
Termination nodes do not have to respect the whitelist. Termination filtering takes precedence over end node filtering.
| >Friend | end node filter - Only return paths up to a node of the given labels, but continue expansion to match on end nodes beyond it.
End nodes do not have to respect the whitelist to be returned, but expansion beyond them is only allowed if the node has a label in the whitelist.
