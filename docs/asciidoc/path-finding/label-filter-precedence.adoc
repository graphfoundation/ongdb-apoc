Multiple label filter operators are allowed at the same time.
Take the following example:

`labelFilter:'+Person|Movie|-SciFi|>Western|/Romance'`

If we work through this label filter, we can see that:

* `:Person` and `:Movie` labels are whitelisted
* `:SciFi` is blacklisted
* `:Western` is an end node label
* `:Romance` is as a termination label.

The precedence of operator evaluation isn't dependent upon their location in the labelFilter but is fixed:

Blacklist filter `-`, termination filter `/`, end node filter `>`, whitelist filter `+`.

This means:

* No blacklisted label `-` will ever be present in the nodes of paths returned, even if the same label (or another label of a node with a blacklisted label) is included in another filter list.
* If the termination filter `/` or end node filter `>` is used, then only paths up to nodes with those labels will be returned as results. These end nodes are exempt from the whitelist filter.
* If a node is a termination node `/`, no further expansion beyond the node will occur.
* The whitelist only applies to nodes up to but not including end nodes from the termination or end node filters. If no end node or termination node operators are present, then the whitelist applies to all nodes of the path.
* If no whitelist operators are present in the labelFilter, this is treated as if all labels are whitelisted.
