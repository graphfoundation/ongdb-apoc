Uniqueness of nodes and relationships guides the expansion and the returned results.
The table below describes the available values:

[opts=header,cols="m,a"]
|===
| value | description
| RELATIONSHIP_PATH | For each returned node there's a (relationship wise) unique path from the start node to it. This is Cypher's default expansion mode.
| NODE_GLOBAL | A node cannot be traversed more than once. This is what the legacy traversal framework does.
| NODE_LEVEL | Entities on the same level are guaranteed to be unique.
| NODE_PATH | For each returned node there's a unique path from the start node to it.
| NODE_RECENT | This is like NODE_GLOBAL, but only guarantees uniqueness among the most recent visited nodes, with a configurable count. Traversing a huge graph is quite memory intensive in that it keeps track of all the nodes it has visited.
For huge graphs a traverser can hog all the memory in the JVM, causing OutOfMemoryError. Together with this Uniqueness you can supply a count, which is the number of most recent visited nodes. This can cause a node to be visited more than once, but scales infinitely.
| RELATIONSHIP_GLOBAL | A relationship cannot be traversed more than once, whereas nodes can.
| RELATIONSHIP_LEVEL | Entities on the same level are guaranteed to be unique.
| RELATIONSHIP_RECENT | Same as for NODE_RECENT, but for relationships.
| NONE | No restriction (the user will have to manage it)
